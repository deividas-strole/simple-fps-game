# 🔫 Simple FPS Game by Deividas Strole

**Simple FPS Game** is a browser-based first-person shooter built with **vanilla JavaScript** and **HTML5 Canvas**. The player navigates a 3D-like environment, shoots targets, and progresses through levels while experiencing basic FPS mechanics implemented entirely in JavaScript.

Developed as a **learning and portfolio project** to demonstrate game logic, rendering techniques, and interactive UI without external frameworks.
